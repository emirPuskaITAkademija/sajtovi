      Bond is tortured by Oddjob when he refuses to confess his role in trailing
      Goldfinger. In a desperate attempt to escape being cut in two by a
      circular saw, Bond offers to work for Goldfinger, a ruse that Goldfinger
      initially refuses but then accepts. Bond and Tilly are subsequently taken
      to Goldfinger's operational headquarters in a warehouse in New York City.
      They are put to work as secretaries for a meeting between Goldfinger and
      several gangsters (including the Spangled Mob and the Mafia), who have
      been recruited to assist in "Operation Grand Slam"—stealing gold from the
      United States Bullion Depository at Fort Knox. One of the gang leaders,
      Helmut Springer, refuses to join the operation and is killed by Oddjob.
      Bond learns that the operation includes killing the inhabitants of Fort
      Knox by introducing poison into the water supply. He manages to conceal a
      message in the toilet of Goldfinger's private plane, where he hopes it
      will be found and sent to Pinkertons, where his friend and ex-counterpart
      Felix Leiter now works. Operation Grand Slam commences, and it transpires
      that Leiter has found and acted on Bond's message. A battle commences, but
      Goldfinger escapes. Tilly, a lesbian, hopes that one of the gang leaders,
      Pussy Galore (the leader of a gang of lesbian burglars), will protect her,
      but she (Tilly) is killed by Oddjob. Goldfinger, Oddjob and the Mafia
      bosses all escape in the melee. Bond is drugged before his flight back to
      England and wakes to find he has been captured by Goldfinger, who has
      murdered the crime bosses (except Galore), drugged a BOAC flightcrew and
      hijacked their jetliner. Bond manages to break a window, causing a
      depressurisation that blows Oddjob out of the plane; he then fights and
      strangles Goldfinger. At gunpoint, he forces the crew to ditch in the sea
      near the Canadian coast, where they are rescued by a nearby weathership.

    <h2>Background and writing history</h2>
    <p>
      By January 1958 the author Ian Fleming had published five novels in the
      preceding five years: Casino Royale in 1953, Live and Let Die (1954),
      Moonraker (1955), Diamonds Are Forever (1956) and From Russia, with Love
      in 1957. A sixth, Dr. No, was being edited and prepared for
      production.[2][3][a] That month Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate
      in Jamaica to write Goldfinger. He followed his usual practice, which he
      later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine: "I write for about three
      hours in the morning ... and I do another hour's work between six and
      seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see
      what I have written ... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a
      day."[5] He returned to London in March that year with a 270-page
      typescript, the longest he had produced to that time.[6] He initially gave
      the manuscript the title The Richest Man in the World;[7] few alterations
      were made to the story before publication.[6] Although Fleming did not
      date the events within his novels, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both
      of whom wrote books for Ian Fleming Publications—identified different
      timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a
      whole. Chancellor put the events of Goldfinger in 1957; Griswold is more
      precise, and considers the story to have taken place from late April to
      early June that year.[8][9] Fleming had long been fascinated with
      gold.[10] He was a collector of Spanish doubloons,[11] and he commissioned
      a gold-plated typewriter from the Royal Typewriter Company,[12] although
      he never actually used it;[10][b] he wrote with a gold-tipped ballpoint
      pen and included the theft or obtaining of gold in several of his
      stories.[11][c] When researching for Goldfinger, Fleming reinforced his
      knowledge of gold by sending a questionnaire to an expert at the
      Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths—one of the livery companies of the City
      of London who assay precious metals for purity—with a list of queries
      about gold, its properties and the background of the industry, including
      smuggling.[15] Fleming had originally conceived the card game scene as a
      separate short story but instead used the device for Bond and Goldfinger's
      first encounter.[10] The architect Ernő Goldfinger threatened to sue
      Fleming over the use of the name. With the book already printed but not
      released, Fleming threatened to add an erratum slip to the book changing
      the name from Goldfinger to Goldprick and explaining why;[16] the matter
      was settled out of court after the publishers, Jonathan Cape, paid Ernő's
      legal costs, agreed to ensure the name Auric was always used in
      conjunction with Goldfinger and sent him six copies of the novel.[17][18]
      Once Fleming completed the novel—which he found the easiest of all the
      Bond books to write—he thought he had exhausted his inspiration for plots.
      He told the writer William Plomer—his friend who proof-read all the Bond
      books—that Goldfinger was to be "the last full length folio on Bond ...
      Though I may be able to think up some episodes for him in the future, I
      shall never be able to give him 70,000 words again".[19] Development

      Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms,
      profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the
      implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming language,
      commonly referred to as coding).
